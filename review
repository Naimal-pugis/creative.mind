During my GitHub assignment, I faced some challenges i took some help from chatgpt. Initially,i started taking tutorials and it seems easy to me . so i got some familiarity with Git commands, it is my first experience in technical work as i was medical student,so i took some help of chatgpt in creating codes for my portfolio *creative.mind*, i face some difficulty in coding . As i wasn't a professional, so there's always remain some error due to wrong command or writing mistakes. I had to go through multiple tutorials and documentation, as each error message led to a different solution.

Another difficulty came with making change in repository. While working on my project, I made sometimes there comes some error due to unknown reason and i use chatgpt to solve it. When I tried to pull changes, I faced unexpected error in several files. This was frustrating but after reloading or opening terminal after closing solve my problem. sometimes there comes error in running same command but after a while i resolved by its own.

but my experience in doing this assignment was good . i learned many things and got proficiency in git and  git hub and got more interest in finding more commands and exploring more thing. At end i used wrong command to pushh ans instead of push i use pull command to transfer my files tp git hub my overall experience  was good and I feel much more confident in git or git hub
