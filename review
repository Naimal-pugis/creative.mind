During my recent GitHub assignment, I faced several challenges that required persistence and a lot of troubleshooting. Initially, the most significant hurdle was setting up Git and linking it to my GitHub repository. Although I had some familiarity with Git commands, configuring SSH keys and ensuring my repository, *creative.mind*, was properly linked to my local system was trickier than expected. I encountered authentication issues, which took a considerable amount of time to resolve. I had to go through multiple tutorials and documentation to troubleshoot, as each error message led to a different solution.

Another difficulty came with handling merge conflicts. While working on my project, I made multiple commits both locally and directly on the GitHub repository without synchronizing them properly. When I tried to pull changes, I faced unexpected conflicts in several files. This was frustrating because I had to identify the differences line-by-line and decide how to merge them. Navigating these conflicts made me more aware of the importance of maintaining a clean commit history and syncing regularly.

Lastly, using GitHubâ€™s branching and pull request features posed its own challenges. I had to create feature branches to work on new sections, but keeping track of changes across different branches was confusing. At times, I accidentally pushed to the wrong branch or forgot to merge, which led to inconsistencies in the project. Although difficult, these experiences improved my understanding of Git commands and workflows, and I feel much more confident managing repositories now.
